British Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig wrote in his diary, "My officers and I were aware that such weapons would cause harm to women and children living in nearby towns, as strong winds were common in the battlefront.	5485826 48393 7142619 284 3975912 6185 24953 86 682 381468 -76 94483342 163 8 2343 12143 5615 2736 2310962 29793 31723 6147 59 29736 163 36893436 984865 86 631456 592628 12 254965 28632 2343 397796 86 563 515593449659
Like a Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany sought to redirect the memory of the war to the benefit of its own policies.	9883 1 4123825 851968 6118 5347166 297565 59 43384335 563 737946 94 563 214 59 563 5363485 94 852 926 099838329
It was seen by many in Britain as signalling the end of an era of stability stretching back to the Victorian period, and across Europe many regarded it as a watershed.	85 212 2336 56 7166 86 5485186 12 2856199865 563 363 94 16 341 94 251589856 2543536865 5138 59 563 483594816 0348938 163 134922 374903 7166 43514333 85 12 1 2153426339
Furthermore, it was common for Germans in the 1930s to justify acts of aggression due to perceived injustices imposed by the victors of World War I. American historian William Rubinstein wrote that: The 'Age of Totalitarianism' included nearly all the infamous examples of genocide in modern history, headed by the Jewish Holocaust, but also comprising the mass murders and purges of the Communist world, other mass killings carried out by Nazi Germany and its allies, and also the Armenian Genocide of 1915.	474563479438 85 212 397796 494 5347162 86 563 19302 59 7725846 1352 94 1554322896 373 59 034338433 8677258332 8709233 56 563 4835942 94 29493 214 89 17348316 682594816 2899817 4758625386 24953 56150 563 -153 94 595198514816827- 86397333 631496 199 563 86417972 32170932 94 53693833 86 793346 68259468 631333 56 563 732826 6999317258 575 1929 3970482865 563 7122 7743342 163 074532 94 563 397776825 294938 95634 7122 88998652 3144833 975 56 6118 5347166 163 852 1998328 163 1929 563 14736816 53693833 94 19159

They have dynamically changed according to contemporary influences, reflecting in the 1950s perceptions of the war as "aimless" following the contrasting Second World War and emphasising conflict within the ranks during times of class conflict in the 1960s.	5636 6143 36617831996 3616533 133943865 59 396537094146 86497363328 4349335865 86 563 19502 03433058962 94 563 214 12 -1879322- 499992865 563 39654125865 233963 29493 214 163 37061282865 39649835 285686 563 41682 374865 58732 94 39122 39649835 86 563 196029

There was no resistance when the Social Democrat Philipp Scheidemann on 9 November declared Germany to be a republic.	56343 212 69 4328251633 2636 563 293819 33793415 0689800 23638337166 96 9 69437534 33391433 5347166 59 53 1 430759839
In time, chemical weapons were deployed by all major belligerents throughout the war, inflicting approximately 1.3 million casualties, but relatively few fatalities: About 90,000 in total.	86 58738 36378319 2310962 2343 33099633 56 199 71794 539985343652 5649756975 563 2148 8649835865 1004928715396 193 7899896 31271958328 575 4391584396 432 41519858320 15975 908000 86 595199

The German Army destroyed 15,000–20,000 buildings—most famously the university library at Louvain—and generated a wave of refugees of over a million people.	563 534716 1476 332549633 158000–208000 578938652—7925 41797296 563 7684342856 9854146 15 9974186—163 536341533 1 2143 94 43475332 94 9434 1 7899896 0390939

However, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action.	69234348 1003192 59 0154895827 163 37568 12 2399 12 7122 1443252 163 5481928 3639741533 563 29938342 59 435746 59 334363 56384 543636328 19569756 563 443636 29938342 4347233 59 01458380153 86 4745634 944362843 1358969
At least 250,000 Assyrian Christians, about half of the population, and 350,000–750,000 Anatolian and Pontic Greeks were killed between 1915 and 1922.	15 93125 2508000 12264816 36482581628 15975 6194 94 563 09079158968 163 3508000–7508000 161599816 163 096583 543382 2343 889933 5352336 1915 163 19229
The Big Four (Britain, France, the United States, and Italy) imposed their terms on the defeated powers in a series of treaties agreed at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, the most well known being the German peace treaty—the Treaty of Versailles.	563 585 4974 954851868 4416338 563 768533 2515328 163 851960 8709233 56384 53472 96 563 33431533 092342 86 1 234832 94 54315832 154333 15 563 1919 01482 03133 39643436338 563 7925 2399 86926 53865 563 534716 03133 543156—563 543156 94 43421899329
For the first ten months of 1915, Austria-Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy.	494 563 48425 536 796562 94 19158 1725481-6765146 7233 7925 94 852 78985146 43234432 59 48565 851969
Despite this enormous German success, the manpower required by the Germans to occupy the captured territory may have contributed to the failure of their Spring Offensive, and secured relatively little food or other materiel for the Central Powers war effort.	3320853 5682 36947972 534716 27333228 563 71609234 43178433 56 563 5347162 59 933706 563 31057433 534485946 716 6143 39654857533 59 563 4189743 94 56384 204865 9443628438 163 2337433 4391584396 985593 4993 94 95634 71534839 494 563 3365419 092342 214 3449459
When Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it sparked the 33-day Second Balkan War, by the end of which it lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, and Southern Dobruja to Romania, further destabilising the region.	2636 57951481 15513833 234581 163 543333 96 16 7763 19138 85 2014833 563 33-316 233963 519816 2148 56 563 363 94 26836 85 9925 7925 94 713339681 59 234581 163 5433338 163 29756346 3954771 59 49716818 4745634 3325158982865 563 4358969

The German flotilla and Dresden sank two armoured cruisers at the Battle of Coronel, but was virtually destroyed at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914, with only Dresden and a few auxiliaries escaping, but after the Battle of Más a Tierra these too had been destroyed or interned.	563 534716 49958991 163 3432336 2168 529 14797433 34782342 15 563 515593 94 39496398 575 212 484571996 332549633 15 563 515593 94 563 41989163 8291632 86 33337534 19148 2856 9696 3432336 163 1 432 17289814832 323108658 575 14534 563 515593 94 7á2 1 583441 56323 599 613 5336 332549633 94 865346339

Most of these would be forgotten in the interwar period until World War II revived the need.	7925 94 56323 29793 53 494595536 86 563 86534214 034893 76589 29493 214 88 4348433 563 63339
German Revolution 1918–1919 News of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces.	534716 4349975896 1918–1919 6322 94 5347166-2 870363865 78985146 334315 204313 5649756975 563 534716 14733 4943329
The war was fought in and drew upon each power's colonial empire as well, spreading the conflict to Africa and across the globe.	563 214 212 497565 86 163 3432 7096 3136 09234-2 39996819 370843 12 23998 204313865 563 39649835 59 144831 163 134922 563 599539
According to the British judge and legal philosopher Patrick Devlin, "The War Orders given by the Admiralty on 26 August [1914] were clear enough.	133943865 59 563 5485826 77353 163 93519 06899290634 0154838 3349868 -563 214 943342 58436 56 563 137841956 96 26 175725 -1914= 2343 39314 3697569
After heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted.	14534 63146 485658658 69234348 563 944362843 212 6195339
With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front.	2856 534716 43864943373652 163 632 17348316 549902 0974865 868 563 9753973 212 59 53 3338333 96 563 2325346 449659
German General Staff assumptions that it would be able to defeat the British and French forces before American troops reinforced them were proven incorrect.The United States Navy sent a battleship group to Scapa Flow to join with the British Grand Fleet, destroyers to Queenstown, Ireland, and submarines to help guard convoys.	534716 5363419 25144 12277058962 5615 85 29793 53 1593 59 334315 563 5485826 163 443636 494332 534943 17348316 549902 4386494333 5637 2343 049436 8639443359563 768533 251532 6146 2365 1 5155932680 54970 59 23101 4992 59 7986 2856 563 5485826 54163 493358 3325496342 59 17336259268 84391638 163 2757148632 59 6390 57143 39649629
The problems of re-supply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic.Following Operation Michael, Germany launched Operation Georgette against the northern English Channel ports.	563 04959372 94 43-270096 2343 1929 32133451533 56 8634312865 382516332 5615 692 254353633 9434 5344186 5615 212 26399-5946 163 94536 8701221593 59 54144839499992865 903415896 78361398 5347166 91763633 903415896 539453553 1518625 563 69456346 3659826 3616639 094529
Finally, on 28 July 1914, a month after the assassination, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia.	48619968 96 28 7796 19148 1 79656 14534 563 12212286158968 1725481-6765146 33391433 214 96 2345819
Germany and Russia were similarly affected.	5347166 163 472281 2343 287891496 144335339
By 1914, their military utility was obvious.	56 19148 56384 78985146 7589856 212 95489729
The agreements did not constitute formal alliances, but by settling long-standing colonial disputes, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility; these interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the Triple Entente.	563 1543373652 383 695 3962585753 494719 1998163328 575 56 23559865 9965-25163865 39996819 382075328 5636 7133 5485826 36546 8659 166 475743 39649835 864994865 441633 94 472281 1 092285898560 56323 865349938865 589153419 1543373652 533173 86926 12 563 548093 36536539

This offensive opened with great promise for the Allies, before bogging down in the October mud.	5682 944362843 903633 2856 54315 0497823 494 563 1998328 534943 5955865 3926 86 563 9359534 7739

To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily from Wall Street.	59 016 494 074361232 86 563 768533 2515328 5485186 312633 86 852 325362843 86432573652 86 17348316 418949132 163 5636 53516 594492865 6314896 4497 2199 2543359
The Allies struck back at Soissons, which showed the Germans that they must return to the defensive, and at Amiens; tanks played a prominent role in both these assaults, as they had the year before at Cambrai.	563 199832 254738 5138 15 298229628 26836 269233 563 5347162 5615 5636 7725 435746 59 563 3343628438 163 15 1783620 51682 091633 1 049786365 4993 86 5956 56323 122179528 12 5636 613 563 6314 534943 15 31754189
Naval war At the start of the war, the German Empire had cruisers scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied merchant shipping.	61419 214 15 563 25145 94 563 2148 563 534716 370843 613 34782342 231553433 134922 563 599538 2973 94 26836 2343 275231736596 7233 59 155138 199833 73436165 268008659

Concerned by Russia's victory in the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War and their influence in the Balkans, the League was dissolved in 1878, with Germany and Austria-Hungary subsequently forming the 1879 Dual Alliance; this became the Triple Alliance when Italy joined in 1882.The practical details of these alliances were limited, since their primary purpose was to ensure cooperation between the three Imperial Powers and isolate France.	396334633 56 472281-2 4835946 86 563 1877–1878 47229-5748826 214 163 56384 864973633 86 563 51981628 563 931573 212 382299433 86 18788 2856 5347166 163 1725481-6765146 275231736596 4947865 563 1879 3719 199816330 5682 533173 563 548093 19981633 2636 85196 798633 86 18829563 041358319 3351892 94 56323 199816332 2343 98785338 28633 56384 0487146 0740923 212 59 362743 39903415896 5352336 563 56433 87034819 092342 163 8299153 4416339

For the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on five issues: propaganda campaigns; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations (Italy, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Romania) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers, especially among Czechs, Poles, and Arabs.	494 563 7925 01458 2145873 380997136 4937233 96 4843 8227320 0490151631 3170185620 33486865 163 4333486865 563 214 591928 26836 533173 6142634 12 563 214 2365 960 974865 6375419 6158962 9851968 9559716 3708438 579514818 49716810 8659 563 391985896 56 94434865 298332 94 36376 5344859460 163 3639741537365 56 563 199832 94 6158961982583 78694856 794373652 862833 563 3365419 0923428 3203381996 17965 3133628 099328 163 141529

The nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning, giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival.	563 615743 94 275714863 2144143 73165 5615 1551382 94536 3173 2856975 21468658 584865 563 34322 94 563 73436165 26802 985593 6903 94 274484199
The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), hydrophones (passive sonar, 1917), blimps, hunter-killer submarines (HMS R-1, 1917), forward-throwing anti-submarine weapons, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918).	563 331562 94 5485826 73436165 2189942 163 563 2337865 864796341589856 94 7-59152 933 59 563 33439907365 94 33056 3614532 9191608 66349069632 90122843 296148 191708 5987028 676534-889934 2757148632 9672 4-18 191708 4942143-56492865 1658-275714863 23109628 163 3800865 66349069632 9563 915534 529 5956 151639633 86 191809

He surprised the two-or-three thousand cadets by declaring (in the words of Donald Christopher Smith, a Bermudian cadet who was present), that war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated.	63 274048233 563 529-94-56433 56972163 313352 56 333914865 986 563 29432 94 396193 36482590634 278568 1 534773816 31335 269 212 043236508 5615 214 269793 53 1498333 15 197925 166 39258 5615 214 29793 29943 69568658 5615 563 26993 94 374903 163 7943 5328332 29793 53 4337333 59 47868 163 5615 563 9922 94 9843 29793 53 29 91453 5615 26993 09079158962 29793 53 3338715339

This resulted in the stab-in-the-back legend, which attributed Germany's defeat not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the 1918 flu pandemic and unfit to fight), but to the public's failure to respond to its "patriotic calling" and the supposed intentional sabotage of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists, and Bolsheviks.	5682 43279533 86 563 2515-86-563-5138 9353638 26836 1554857533 5347166-2 334315 695 59 852 861589856 59 39658673 48565865 93436 569756 70 59 1 7899896 29938342 2343 274434865 4497 563 1918 497 01633783 163 76485 59 4856508 575 59 563 075983-2 4189743 59 4320963 59 852 -015489583 3199865- 163 563 27009233 86536589619 21595153 94 563 214 3449458 014583791496 56 73228 29381982528 163 59926348829

The war increased female employment; however, the return of demobilised men displaced many from the workforce, as did the closure of many of the wartime factories.	563 214 863431233 437193 37099673650 69234348 563 435746 94 33795898233 736 382091333 7166 4497 563 2948494338 12 383 563 3992743 94 7166 94 563 2145873 4135948329
Yet at the time of the armistice, no Allied force had crossed the German frontier, the Western Front was still some 720 kilometres (450 mi) from Berlin, and the Kaiser's armies had retreated from the battlefield in good order.	635 15 563 5873 94 563 1478258338 69 199833 49433 613 3492233 563 534716 449658348 563 2325346 44965 212 25899 2973 720 8899735432 9450 780 4497 5349868 163 563 818234-2 147832 613 435431533 4497 563 51559348393 86 5993 943349

All these slaughters, it is argued here, had a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern Europe as a result of World War I, without which surely neither Communism nor Fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots.	199 56323 29175653428 85 82 145733 63438 613 1 397796 9485868 563 39991023 94 563 39853 254735743 163 694719 79332 94 5943467365 94 7736 94 33654198 3125346 163 29756346 374903 12 1 432795 94 29493 214 88 2856975 26836 274396 6385634 397776827 694 4123827 29793 6143 3282533 323305 86 563 78632 94 7686926 158515942 163 3413809529

The German high command responded by despatching troops to hold the line, but these forces were far too weak to reestablish a front.The disappearance of the Macedonian front meant that the road to Budapest and Vienna was now opened to Allied forces.	563 534716 6856 3977163 432096333 56 33201536865 549902 59 6993 563 98638 575 56323 494332 2343 414 599 2318 59 43325159826 1 449659563 3821003141633 94 563 7133396816 44965 73165 5615 563 4913 59 57310325 163 483661 212 692 903633 59 199833 4943329

Some war memorials date the end of the war as being when the Versailles Treaty was signed in 1919, which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned home; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918.	2973 214 737948192 3153 563 363 94 563 214 12 53865 2636 563 4342189932 543156 212 285633 86 19198 26836 212 2636 7166 94 563 549902 2344865 154913 4861996 43574633 69730 56 396541258 7925 39773794158962 94 563 214-2 363 39633654153 96 563 147825833 94 11 69437534 19189

The legend of the "stab in the back" and the wish to revise the "Versailles diktat", and the belief in an international threat aimed at the elimination of the German nation persisted at the heart of German politics.	563 935363 94 563 -2515 86 563 5138- 163 563 2826 59 434823 563 -4342189932 388515-8 163 563 539834 86 16 8653461589619 564315 18733 15 563 39878615896 94 563 534716 615896 034282533 15 563 63145 94 534716 099858329
In 1911, Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg acknowledged defeat, leading to the Rüstungswende or ‘armaments turning point', when Germany switched expenditure from the navy to the army.This was driven by Russia's recovery from the 1905 Revolution, specifically increased investment post 1908 in railways and infrastructure in its western border regions.	86 19118 3616339994 56395193 496 53567166-6999235 138692933533 3343158 9313865 59 563 4ü25765223633 94 ‘147173652 5746865 09865-8 2636 5347166 22853633 32036385743 4497 563 6146 59 563 147695682 212 348436 56 472281-2 43394346 4497 563 1905 43499758968 203384831996 863431233 8643257365 0925 1908 86 41892162 163 86441254735743 86 852 2325346 594334 43589629

However, conditions were terrible in Russia: starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; about 15–20% of the prisoners in Russia died, and in Central Powers imprisonment 8% of Russians.	69234348 3963858962 2343 53448593 86 4722810 2514415896 212 397796 494 048296342 163 384898162 198830 15975 15–205 94 563 048296342 86 472281 38338 163 86 3365419 092342 870482967365 85 94 472281629
Ultimately, as a result of the war the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian Empires ceased to exist, with numerous new states created from their remains.	79587153968 12 1 432795 94 563 214 563 172549-6765148168 5347168 95597168 163 4722816 3708432 331233 59 328258 2856 67734972 632 251532 3431533 4497 56384 43718629

The Entente and its allies would eventually become known as the Allied Powers, while the grouping of Austria-Hungary, Germany and their allies would become known as the Central Powers.	563 3653653 163 852 199832 29793 3436571996 533973 86926 12 563 199833 0923428 26893 563 54970865 94 1725481-67651468 5347166 163 56384 199832 29793 533973 86926 12 563 3365419 0923429
Once prisoners reached a camp, conditions were, in general, satisfactory (and much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the International Red Cross and inspections by neutral nations.	9633 048296342 4313633 1 31708 3963858962 23438 86 53634198 215824135946 9163 7736 535534 5616 86 29493 214 8808 561682 86 0145 59 563 3449452 94 563 8653461589619 433 34922 163 86203358962 56 6375419 61589629
Close to battlefields, those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the American Battle Monuments Commission, the German War Graves Commission, and Le Souvenir français.	39923 59 5155934839328 56923 574833 86 8704948233 574819 5497632 2343 541371996 79433 59 494719 5414361432 76334 563 3143 94 9451682158962 2736 12 563 397796231956 214 541432 39778228968 563 17348316 515593 796773652 39778228968 563 534716 214 541432 39778228968 163 93 29743684 4416ç1829

The government of Turkey has consistently denied the genocide, arguing that those who died were victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine, or disease during World War I; these claims are rejected by most historians.Other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the Ottoman Empire during this period, including Assyrians and Greeks, and some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination.	563 5943467365 94 574836 612 396282536596 336833 563 536938338 1457865 5615 56923 269 3833 2343 4835872 94 86534-356683 485658658 4178638 94 3823123 374865 29493 214 80 56323 391872 143 43733533 56 7925 6825948162995634 356683 549702 2343 287891496 15513833 56 563 9559716 370843 374865 5682 0348938 863973865 122648162 163 5433828 163 2973 23699142 39628334 56923 343652 59 53 0145 94 563 2173 099836 94 32534786158969
The use of chemical weapons in warfare was in direct violation of the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, which prohibited their use.The effect of poison gas was not limited to combatants.	563 723 94 36378319 2310962 86 2144143 212 86 384335 489915896 94 563 1899 61573 33391415896 3963346865 120662815865 51232 163 563 1907 61573 3964365896 96 9163 21441438 26836 0496858533 56384 7239563 344335 94 098296 512 212 695 9878533 59 39751516529

A smaller part of the Arras offensive, the capture of Vimy Ridge by the Canadian Corps, became highly significant to that country: the idea that Canada's national identity was born out of the battle is an opinion widely held in military and general histories of Canada.The last large-scale offensive of this period was a British attack (with French support) at Passchendaele (July–November 1917).	1 2719934 0145 94 563 14412 9443628438 563 3105743 94 4876 48353 56 563 31613816 394028 533173 685696 28568483165 59 5615 39765460 563 8331 5615 316131-2 61589619 83365856 212 5946 975 94 563 515593 82 16 9086896 283396 6393 86 78985146 163 5363419 682594832 94 3161319563 9125 91453-23193 944362843 94 5682 034893 212 1 5485826 155138 92856 443636 27009450 15 0122363631393 97796–69437534 191709

This culminated in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, which marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an effective fighting force.	5682 3797861533 86 563 515593 94 48559489 4363598 26836 714833 563 363 94 563 172549-676514816 1476 12 16 344335843 48565865 494339

During the last week of October, declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague, and Zagreb.	374865 563 9125 2338 94 93595348 333914158962 94 863303633633 2343 7133 86 573103258 0415738 163 1154359
Among the Allies, the UK spent $21 billion and the US$17 billion; among the Central Powers Germany spent $20 billion.	17965 563 1998328 563 78 20365 421 5899896 163 563 72417 58998960 17965 563 3365419 092342 5347166 20365 420 58998969
At the start of hostilities, Italy refused to commit troops, arguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive and that Austria-Hungary was an aggressor.	15 563 25145 94 692589858328 85196 4347233 59 397785 5499028 1457865 5615 563 548093 19981633 212 334362843 163 5615 1725481-6765146 212 16 1554322949
In February 1916 the Germans attacked French defensive positions at the Battle of Verdun, lasting until December 1916.	86 43547146 1916 563 5347162 15513833 443636 334362843 092858962 15 563 515593 94 4343768 9125865 76589 33337534 19169
In Milan, in May 1917, Bolshevik revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation.	86 789168 86 716 19178 599263488 434997589614832 945168233 163 3651533 86 4895865 3199865 494 16 363 59 563 2148 163 7161533 59 39923 3926 413594832 163 2590 075983 541620945158969
However, their effectiveness would grow as the war progressed; the Allies built tanks in large numbers, whilst the Germans employed only a few of their own design, supplemented by captured Allied tanks.	69234348 56384 3443358436322 29793 5492 12 563 214 04954322330 563 199832 57895 51682 86 91453 67753428 268925 563 5347162 37099633 9696 1 432 94 56384 926 3328568 270093736533 56 31057433 199833 516829
Soldiers' experiences The British soldiers of the war were initially volunteers but increasingly were conscripted into service.	29938342- 32034836332 563 5485826 29938342 94 563 214 2343 868581996 4997653342 575 863431286596 2343 39623480533 8659 23448339
Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the Balkans, which came to be known as the "powder keg of Europe".In 1912 and 1913, the First Balkan War was fought between the Balkan League and the fracturing Ottoman Empire.	4722816 099858319 71693744865 86 563 435896 332515898233 03133 1339432 5615 2343 1943136 4413574865 86 563 51981628 26836 3173 59 53 86926 12 563 -092334 835 94 374903-986 1912 163 19138 563 48425 519816 214 212 497565 5352336 563 519816 931573 163 563 4413574865 9559716 3708439
The total sum was divided into three categories, with the third being "deliberately designed to be chimerical" and its "primary function was to mislead public opinion ... into believing the "total sum was being maintained."	563 59519 277 212 3848333 8659 56433 31535948328 2856 563 56843 53865 -339853415396 33285633 59 53 3687348319- 163 852 -0487146 47635896 212 59 7829313 075983 9086896 999 8659 539834865 563 -59519 277 212 53865 71865186339-
The Serbs suffered defeat in the Battle of Kosovo.	563 23452 27443433 334315 86 563 515593 94 8929499
The effect of this at the start of the war was that well over a quarter of the rank and file were Slavs, while more than 75% of the officers were ethnic Germans.	563 344335 94 5682 15 563 25145 94 563 214 212 5615 2399 9434 1 1714534 94 563 4168 163 4893 2343 291428 26893 7943 5616 755 94 563 94483342 2343 356683 53471629
Formal end of the war A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until the signing of the Treaty of Versailles with Germany on 28 June 1919.	494719 363 94 563 214 1 494719 25153 94 214 5352336 563 529 28332 034282533 494 1695634 23436 7965628 76589 563 2856865 94 563 543156 94 4342189932 2856 5347166 96 28 7763 19199
It was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought, and it was one of the first times that Australian troops fought as Australians, not just subjects of the British Crown.	85 212 563 48425 71794 214 86 26836 563 63296 32515982633 397654832 4975658 163 85 212 963 94 563 48425 58732 5615 1725419816 549902 497565 12 172541981628 695 7725 27573352 94 563 5485826 349269
Even a man of peace such as [Gustav] Stresemann publicly rejected German guilt.	3436 1 716 94 03133 2736 12 -572514= 2543237166 07598396 43733533 534716 578959
Contemporary Europeans also referred to it as "the war to end war" or "the war to end all wars" due to their perception of its then-unparalleled scale and devastation.	396537094146 374903162 1929 43434433 59 85 12 -563 214 59 363 214- 94 -563 214 59 363 199 2142- 373 59 56384 0343305896 94 852 5636-760141993933 23193 163 334125158969
With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front.	2856 534716 43864943373652 163 632 17348316 549902 0974865 868 563 9753973 212 59 53 3338333 96 563 2325346 449659
After conquest, Serbia was divided between Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria.In late 1915, a Franco-British force landed at Salonica in Greece to offer assistance and to pressure its government to declare war against the Central Powers.	14534 396173258 234581 212 3848333 5352336 172549-6765146 163 57951481986 9153 19158 1 441639-5485826 49433 916333 15 21996831 86 543333 59 94434 1228251633 163 59 04322743 852 5943467365 59 3339143 214 1518625 563 3365419 0923429
Battle of Albert British and Dominion forces launched the next phase of the campaign with the Battle of Albert on 21 August.	515593 94 195345 5485826 163 39786896 494332 91763633 563 6325 06123 94 563 31701856 2856 563 515593 94 195345 96 21 1757259
On 23 July, Austria-Hungary delivered to Serbia the July Ultimatum, a series of ten demands that were made intentionally unacceptable, in an effort to provoke a war with Serbia.	96 23 77968 1725481-6765146 339843433 59 234581 563 7796 7958715778 1 234832 94 536 3371632 5615 2343 7133 8653658961996 7613330515938 86 16 344945 59 0494983 1 214 2856 2345819
The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the Selective Draft Law Cases on 7 January 1918.	563 2704373 39745 76168797296 706393 563 39625857589619856 94 563 34145 135 86 563 239335843 34145 912 31232 96 7 7167146 19189
In 1918 the Germans smashed through the defence lines in three great attacks: Michael, on the Lys, and on the Aisne, which displayed the power of their new tactics.	86 1918 563 5347162 2712633 5649756 563 3343633 98632 86 56433 54315 15513820 78361398 96 563 9628 163 96 563 182638 26836 382091633 563 09234 94 56384 632 51358329
After this victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several Italian offensives, centred on the Banjšice and Karst Plateau east of Gorizia.	14534 5682 48359468 563 44965 43718633 251583 494 9434 1 63148 3320853 2343419 8519816 94436284328 3365433 96 563 5167š833 163 81425 0915317 3125 94 59481819
The years of trench warfare on the Western front achieved no major exchanges of territory and, as a result, are often thought of as static and unchanging.	563 63142 94 543636 2144143 96 563 2325346 44965 13683433 69 71794 323616532 94 534485946 1638 12 1 4327958 143 94536 5697565 94 12 251583 163 76361658659
Irish nationalists and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence, culminating in the Easter Rising of 1916, with Germany sending 20,000 rifles to Ireland to stir unrest in Britain.	84826 615896198252 163 71428252 155370533 59 074273 84826 8633036336338 37978615865 86 563 312534 482865 94 19168 2856 5347166 2363865 208000 484932 59 8439163 59 2584 764325 86 54851869
This allowed the transfer of large numbers of German troops from the East to the Western Front, resulting in the German March 1918 Offensive.	5682 1999233 563 54162434 94 91453 6775342 94 534716 549902 4497 563 3125 59 563 2325346 449658 432795865 86 563 534716 71436 1918 9443628439
Many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from shell shock (also called neurasthenia, a condition related to posttraumatic stress disorder).	7166 29938342 43574633 2856 234343 5417718 274434865 4497 26399 26938 91929 319933 6374125636818 1 396385896 4391533 59 0925541771583 254322 3829433409
Andorra declared war on Germany in August 1914.	1639441 33391433 214 96 5347166 86 175725 19149
The opening day of the offensive (1 July 1916) was the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army, suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead.	563 9036865 316 94 563 944362843 91 7796 19160 212 563 599938325 316 86 563 6825946 94 563 5485826 14768 274434865 578470 31271958328 863973865 198240 33139
On 22 April 1915, at the Second Battle of Ypres, the Germans (violating the Hague Convention) used chlorine gas for the first time on the Western Front.	96 22 10489 19158 15 563 233963 515593 94 604328 563 5347162 9489915865 563 61573 39643658960 7233 36994863 512 494 563 48425 5873 96 563 2325346 449659

On 25 July, Russia, in support of Serbia, declared partial mobilisation against Austria-Hungary.	96 25 77968 4722818 86 2700945 94 2345818 33391433 0145819 795898215896 1518625 1725481-67651469
The Romanian offensive was initially successful in Transylvania, but a Central Powers counterattack by the drove them back.	563 49716816 944362843 212 868581996 2733322479 86 5416269416818 575 1 3365419 092342 3976534155138 56 563 34943 5637 51389
After this victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several Italian offensives, centred on the Banjšice and Karst Plateau east of Gorizia.	14534 5682 48359468 563 44965 43718633 251583 494 9434 1 63148 3320853 2343419 8519816 94436284328 3365433 96 563 5167š833 163 81425 0915317 3125 94 59481819
The problems of re-supply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic.Following Operation Michael, Germany launched Operation Georgette against the northern English Channel ports.	563 04959372 94 43-270096 2343 1929 32133451533 56 8634312865 382516332 5615 692 254353633 9434 5344186 5615 212 26399-5946 163 94536 8701221593 59 54144839499992865 903415896 78361398 5347166 91763633 903415896 539453553 1518625 563 69456346 3659826 3616639 094529
Germany, however, envisioned Austria-Hungary directing most of its troops against Russia, while Germany dealt with France.	53471668 69234348 3648289633 1725481-6765146 384335865 7925 94 852 549902 1518625 4722818 26893 5347166 33195 2856 4416339
An estimated 100,000–260,000 civilian casualties were caused by chemical weapons during the conflict and tens of thousands more (along with military personnel) died from scarring of the lungs, skin damage, and cerebral damage in the years after the conflict ended.	16 325871533 1008000–2608000 38489816 3127195832 2343 317233 56 36378319 2310962 374865 563 39649835 163 5362 94 569721632 7943 919965 2856 78985146 0342966390 3833 4497 23144865 94 563 976528 2886 3171538 163 33435419 317153 86 563 63142 14534 563 39649835 363339

In Britain in 1914, the Public Schools Officers' Training Corps annual camp was held at Tidworth Pennings, near Salisbury Plain.	86 5485186 86 19148 563 075983 2369992 94483342- 54186865 39402 166719 3170 212 6393 15 58329456 036686528 6314 219825746 091869
The British and French magnified the reports and disseminated them at home and in the United States, where they played a major role in dissolving support for Germany.	563 5485826 163 443636 715684833 563 4309452 163 382237861533 5637 15 6973 163 86 563 768533 2515328 26343 5636 091633 1 71794 4993 86 3822994865 2700945 494 53471669
In December, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia, thus freeing large numbers of German troops for use in the west.	86 333375348 563 3365419 092342 285633 16 147825833 2856 4722818 5672 4433865 91453 6775342 94 534716 549902 494 723 86 563 23259
He was, however, a poor commander.	63 2128 69234348 1 0994 3977163349
The new system worked smoothly.	563 632 262537 294833 279956969
Eastern Front Initial actions Russian plans for the start of the war called for simultaneous invasions of Austrian Galicia and East Prussia.	3125346 44965 8685819 1358962 4722816 09162 494 563 25145 94 563 214 319933 494 287795163972 864128962 94 17254816 5198381 163 3125 04722819
World War I (often abbreviated as WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War or the Great War, was a global war that lasted from 1914 to 1918.	29493 214 8 994536 15543481533 12 228 94 22108 1929 86926 12 563 48425 29493 214 94 563 54315 2148 212 1 599519 214 5615 912533 4497 1914 59 19189
Progress of the war Opening hostilities Confusion among the Central Powers The strategy of the Central Powers suffered from miscommunication.	04954322 94 563 214 9036865 69258985832 396472896 17965 563 3365419 092342 563 25415356 94 563 3365419 092342 27443433 4497 78239777683158969
Officer recruitment, however, was voluntary.	9448334 433478573658 69234348 212 4997651469
During the last week of August the Allied pressure along a 110-kilometre (68 mi) front against the enemy was heavy and unrelenting.	374865 563 9125 2338 94 175725 563 199833 04322743 19965 1 110-889973543 968 780 44965 1518625 563 36376 212 63146 163 764393658659
On the Trentino front, the Austro-Hungarians took advantage of the mountainous terrain, which favoured the defender.	96 563 54365869 449658 563 172549-6765148162 5998 134165153 94 563 79765186972 53441868 26836 41497433 563 334363349
Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz and Wilhelm II, who became Emperor in 1890, sought to use that to create a Kaiserliche Marine or Imperial German Navy to compete with Britain's Royal Navy for world naval supremacy.	1378419 194433 496 5840851 163 2896397 888 269 533173 3703494 86 18908 297565 59 723 5615 59 343153 1 81823498363 714863 94 87034819 534716 6146 59 3970353 2856 5485186-2 49619 6146 494 29493 61419 2704371369
All nations pledged to follow the Hague Conventions on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and the survival rate for POWs was generally much higher than that of combatants at the front.	199 6158962 0933533 59 499992 563 61573 39643658962 96 4184 543157365 94 048296342 94 2148 163 563 27448419 4153 494 0922 212 536341996 7736 685634 5616 5615 94 3975151652 15 563 449659
With the adoption of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Entente no longer existed.	2856 563 13905896 94 563 543156 94 54325-98594288 563 3653653 69 996534 32825339
It was not until the middle of September that the integrated force was ready for large-scale operations.	85 212 695 76589 563 783393 94 230537534 5615 563 8653541533 49433 212 43136 494 91453-23193 90341589629
Ultimately, the race diverted huge resources to creating a German navy large enough to antagonise Britain, but not defeat it.	79587153968 563 4133 38434533 6753 432974332 59 34315865 1 534716 6146 91453 369756 59 1651596823 54851868 575 695 334315 859
Persia, ostensibly neutral, had long been under the spheres of British and Russian influence.	0342818 9253628596 63754198 613 9965 5336 76334 563 2063432 94 5485826 163 4722816 8649736339

As such, as the German Army increased in size in the years leading up to the war, he changed the allocation of forces between the German right and left wings from 85:15 to 70:30.	12 27368 12 563 534716 1476 863431233 86 2813 86 563 63142 9313865 70 59 563 2148 63 3616533 563 1999315896 94 494332 5352336 563 534716 48565 163 9345 28652 4497 85015 59 700309
In addition, demobilisation and economic decline following the war caused high unemployment.	86 133858968 33795898215896 163 33969783 3339863 499992865 563 214 317233 6856 7637099673659

Many commanders on both sides knew such weapons would cause major harm to civilians but nonetheless continued to use them.	7166 3977163342 96 5956 28332 8632 2736 2310962 29793 31723 71794 6147 59 384898162 575 69635639322 396586733 59 723 56379
British propaganda dramatising the Rape of Belgium attracted much attention in the United States, while Berlin said it was both lawful and necessary because of the threat of franc-tireurs like those in France in 1870.	5485826 0490151631 34171582865 563 4103 94 5395877 155413533 7736 155365896 86 563 768533 2515328 26893 534986 2183 85 212 5956 912479 163 633322146 5331723 94 563 564315 94 44163-5843742 9883 56923 86 441633 86 18709
Health effects Of the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilised from 1914 to 1918, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured.	631956 3443352 94 563 60 7899896 37490316 78985146 034296639 269 2343 795898233 4497 1914 59 19188 8 7899896 2343 8899338 7 7899896 2343 03471636596 382159338 163 15 7899896 2343 234897296 86774339
The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised.	563 7166 37958962 95634 5616 694494 32034836333 56 29938342 86 163 975 94 563 44965 98638 863973865 397413326808 59433978 163 3436 3679673658 6143 5336 43395682339

Many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat akin to modern "embedded" positions within the opposing land and naval forces.	7166 2343 1593 59 430945 96 343652 4497 1 03420335843 29732615 1886 59 793346 -37533333- 092858962 285686 563 90092865 9163 163 61419 4943329
In Austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war's end there was no meat.	86 17254818 494 32170938 7925 0852 2343 291756534338 29 15 214-2 363 56343 212 69 73159
He argued that the war was so important that the US had to have a voice in the peace conference.	63 145733 5615 563 214 212 29 870945165 5615 563 72 613 59 6143 1 49833 86 563 03133 39643436339
Most of these would be forgotten in the interwar period until World War II revived the need.	7925 94 56323 29793 53 494595536 86 563 86534214 034893 76589 29493 214 88 4348433 563 63339
Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented.	56384 94483342 913833 563 73162 59 076826 16 365843 384828968 163 61426 73127432 2343 695 87733815396 870937365339

On 12 August, Britain and France also declared war on Austria-Hungary; on the 23 August, Japan sided with Britain, seizing German possessions in China and the Pacific.	96 12 1757258 5485186 163 441633 1929 33391433 214 96 1725481-67651460 96 563 23 1757258 71016 28333 2856 54851868 2381865 534716 09223228962 86 36861 163 563 01384839
The widespread use of chemical warfare was a distinguishing feature of the conflict.	563 2833204313 723 94 36378319 2144143 212 1 38258657826865 4315743 94 563 396498359
Germany, however, envisioned Austria-Hungary directing most of its troops against Russia, while Germany dealt with France.	53471668 69234348 3648289633 1725481-6765146 384335865 7925 94 852 549902 1518625 4722818 26893 5347166 33195 2856 4416339

In recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular cliché of World War I.	86 433365 631428 6825948162 6143 145733 034271284396 1518625 197925 34346 0907914 39836é 94 29493 214 89
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships.	5485186 78633 8653461589619 215342 59 0434365 166 26802 4497 36534865 365843 23358962 94 933168 3172865 316534 59 3436 6375419 268029
During the six hours between the signing of the armistice and its taking effect, opposing armies on the Western Front began to withdraw from their positions, but fighting continued along many areas of the front, as commanders wanted to capture territory before the war ended.	374865 563 282 69742 5352336 563 2856865 94 563 147825833 163 852 518865 3443358 90092865 147832 96 563 2325346 44965 53516 59 28563412 4497 56384 0928589628 575 48565865 396586733 19965 7166 14312 94 563 449658 12 3977163342 216533 59 3105743 534485946 534943 563 214 363339
By the spring of 1915, the Russians had retreated from Galicia, and, in May, the Central Powers achieved a remarkable breakthrough on Poland's southern frontiers with their Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive.	56 563 204865 94 19158 563 47228162 613 435431533 4497 51983818 1638 86 7168 563 3365419 092342 13683433 1 4371481593 543185649756 96 099163-2 29756346 449658342 2856 56384 5949833–5146ó2 9443628439

Several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides, and though it never proved a decisive, battle-winning weapon, poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war.	2343419 56032 94 512 2996 533173 283396 7233 56 5956 283328 163 569756 85 63434 049433 1 333828438 515593-2866865 2310968 098296 512 533173 963 94 563 7925-431433 163 5325-4373753433 6944942 94 563 2149

Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it.	199833 9313342 613 692 43198233 5615 59 39658673 16 155138 14534 4328251633 613 61433633 212 1 21253 94 984328 163 85 212 535534 59 5746 1 9863 5616 59 546 59 4999 9434 859
When the negotiations failed, his attempt was revealed to Germany, resulting in a diplomatic catastrophe.	2636 563 635958158962 4189338 682 1553705 212 43431933 59 53471668 432795865 86 1 3809971583 315125490639
Thus, both sides urgently sought a decisive victory.In 1917, Emperor Charles I of Austria secretly attempted separate peace negotiations with Clemenceau, through his wife's brother Sixtus in Belgium as an intermediary, without the knowledge of Germany.	56728 5956 28332 74536596 297565 1 33382843 4835946986 19178 3703494 3614932 8 94 1725481 23343596 155370533 23014153 03133 635958158962 2856 39373633178 5649756 682 2843-2 5495634 282572 86 5395877 12 16 8653473381468 2856975 563 869293353 94 53471669
Commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties.	3977163342 96 5956 28332 418933 59 3343990 5135832 494 543136865 3654363633 092858962 2856975 63146 31271958329
The most famous was Eugene Debs, head of the Socialist Party of America, who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell.	563 7925 417972 212 375363 33528 6313 94 563 293819825 01456 94 17348318 269 416 494 043283365 86 1920 4497 682 048296 33999
After this success, the number of Czechoslovak legionaries increased, as well as Czechoslovak military power.	14534 5682 27333228 563 677534 94 313369299418 93589614832 8634312338 12 2399 12 313369299418 78985146 092349

Progress of the war Opening hostilities Confusion among the Central Powers The strategy of the Central Powers suffered from miscommunication.	04954322 94 563 214 9036865 69258985832 396472896 17965 563 3365419 092342 563 25415356 94 563 3365419 092342 27443433 4497 78239777683158969
Similarly, the war strained the abilities of some formerly large and bureaucratised governments, such as in Austria-Hungary and Germany.	2878914968 563 214 25418633 563 158985832 94 2973 49473496 91453 163 57431734158233 594346736528 2736 12 86 1725481-6765146 163 53471669
For the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on five issues: propaganda campaigns; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations (Italy, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Romania) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers, especially among Czechs, Poles, and Arabs.	494 563 7925 01458 2145873 380997136 4937233 96 4843 8227320 0490151631 3170185620 33486865 163 4333486865 563 214 591928 26836 533173 6142634 12 563 214 2365 960 974865 6375419 6158962 9851968 9559716 3708438 579514818 49716810 8659 563 391985896 56 94434865 298332 94 36376 5344859460 163 3639741537365 56 563 199832 94 6158961982583 78694856 794373652 862833 563 3365419 0923428 3203381996 17965 3133628 099328 163 141529
It was worded as such to lay a legal basis for reparations, and a similar clause was inserted in the treaties with Austria and Hungary.	85 212 294333 12 2736 59 916 1 93519 51282 494 430141589628 163 1 2878914 391723 212 86234533 86 563 54315832 2856 1725481 163 67651469
In January 1917, Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare, in the hopes of starving Britain into surrender.	86 7167146 19178 5347166 3338333 59 432773 764325483533 275714863 21441438 86 563 69032 94 25144865 5485186 8659 2744363349

Ultimately, as a result of the war the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian Empires ceased to exist, with numerous new states created from their remains.	79587153968 12 1 432795 94 563 214 563 172549-6765148168 5347168 95597168 163 4722816 3708432 331233 59 328258 2856 67734972 632 251532 3431533 4497 56384 43718629
Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties and consumed vast quantities of explosives.	145899346 212 43209628593 494 563 9145325 677534 94 3127195832 163 39627733 4125 1716585832 94 32099284329
When the besieged garrison of Kaunas surrendered in 1915, some 20,000 Russians became prisoners, at the battle near Przasnysz (February–March 1915) 14,000 Germans surrendered to Russians, and at the First Battle of the Marne about 12,000 Germans surrendered to the Allies.	2636 563 53283533 51448296 94 817612 27443633433 86 19158 2973 208000 47228162 533173 0482963428 15 563 515593 6314 041126621 943547146–71436 19150 148000 5347162 27443633433 59 472281628 163 15 563 48425 515593 94 563 71463 15975 128000 5347162 27443633433 59 563 1998329
With the fall of the Ottoman government, power vacuums developed and conflicting claims to land and nationhood began to emerge.	2856 563 4199 94 563 9559716 59434673658 09234 4137772 334399033 163 39649835865 391872 59 9163 163 6158966993 53516 59 3734539
The Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes, wrote to the British prime minister, Lloyd George, "You have assured us that you cannot get better terms.	563 1725419816 04873 786825348 58996 6756328 24953 59 563 5485826 04873 786825348 99963 5394538 -697 6143 1227433 72 5615 697 316695 535 535534 534729
Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising.	76852 94 563 534716 6146 4347233 59 235 2189 494 1 91258 91453-23193 903415896 86 1 214 5636 53983433 59 53 12 5993 12 99258 8685815865 563 704828659
Germany sought to strangle Allied sea lanes before the United States could transport a large army overseas, but after initial successes eventually failed to do so.The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships began travelling in convoys, escorted by destroyers.	5347166 297565 59 25416593 199833 231 91632 534943 563 768533 251532 39793 541620945 1 91453 1476 943423128 575 14534 8685819 273332232 3436571996 418933 59 39 299563 7-5915 564315 93223633 86 19178 2636 73436165 26802 53516 5414399865 86 39649628 32394533 56 33254963429
Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in the Balkans, which came to be known as the "powder keg of Europe".In 1912 and 1913, the First Balkan War was fought between the Balkan League and the fracturing Ottoman Empire.	4722816 099858319 71693744865 86 563 435896 332515898233 03133 1339432 5615 2343 1943136 4413574865 86 563 51981628 26836 3173 59 53 86926 12 563 -092334 835 94 374903-986 1912 163 19138 563 48425 519816 214 212 497565 5352336 563 519816 931573 163 563 4413574865 9559716 3708439
On 24 September an assault by both the British and French came within 3 kilometres (2 mi) of St. Quentin.	96 24 230537534 16 1221795 56 5956 563 5485826 163 443636 3173 285686 3 8899735432 92 780 94 259 17365869
Thus conscription contributed greatly to Austria's disastrous performance on the battlefield.	5672 396234805896 39654857533 5431596 59 1725481-2 3821254972 03449471633 96 563 515593483939
In Australia and New Zealand the Battle of Gallipoli became known as those nations' "Baptism of Fire".	86 172541981 163 632 1319163 563 515593 94 519980998 533173 86926 12 56923 6158962- -5105827 94 4843-9
Both peace offers were rejected.	5956 03133 944342 2343 437335339
Gun fire was not the only factor taking lives; the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides.	576 4843 212 695 563 9696 413594 518865 984320 563 38231232 5615 3734533 86 563 54363632 2343 1 71794 889934 96 5956 283329
In October 1914, the Canadian magazine Maclean's wrote, "Some wars name themselves.	86 9359534 19148 563 31613816 71511863 7139316-2 249538 -2973 2142 6173 56372394329
Of these eleven offensives, five were won by Italy, three remained inconclusive, and the other three were repelled by the Austro-Hungarians, who held the higher ground.	94 56323 393436 94436284328 4843 2343 296 56 851968 56433 43718633 8639639728438 163 563 95634 56433 2343 43039933 56 563 172549-67651481628 269 6393 563 685634 5497639
Germany had promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed.	5347166 613 04978233 59 2700945 1725481-6765146-2 86412896 94 2345818 575 865340435158962 94 2615 5682 73165 384434339
The defenders displayed a marked collapse in morale, causing Ludendorff to refer to this day as the "Black Day of the German army".	563 334363342 382091633 1 714833 39991023 86 7941938 3172865 9733639444 59 43434 59 5682 316 12 563 -59138 316 94 563 534716 1476-9
Such battles include Ypres, the Marne, Cambrai, the Somme, Verdun, and Gallipoli.	2736 5155932 8639733 604328 563 714638 31754188 563 297738 4343768 163 5199809989
On the same day, the German Supreme Army Command informed Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Imperial Chancellor Count Georg von Hertling, that the military situation facing Germany was hopeless .	96 563 2173 3168 563 534716 2704373 1476 3977163 86494733 818234 2896397 88 163 563 87034819 3616339994 39765 53945 496 634598658 5615 563 78985146 285715896 413865 5347166 212 69039322 9

Likewise, the art of Paul Nash, John Nash, Christopher Nevinson, and Henry Tonks in Britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as Muirhead Bone painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate.	988328238 563 145 94 0179 61268 7966 61268 36482590634 634862968 163 63646 59682 86 5485186 0186533 1 63515843 4832 94 563 39649835 86 8330865 2856 563 5492865 03433058968 26893 0907914 214-5873 1458252 2736 12 77846313 5963 0186533 7943 234363 163 09312165 865340435158962 275231736596 43733533 12 86133741539

The 1917 February Revolution in Russia replaced the Tsarist autocracy with the Provisional Government, but continuing discontent with the cost of the war led to the October Revolution, the creation of the Soviet Socialist Republic, and the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk by the new government in March 1918, ending Russia's involvement in the war.	563 1917 43547146 4349975896 86 472281 43091333 563 5214825 175934136 2856 563 04948289619 59434673658 575 3965867865 3823965365 2856 563 3925 94 563 214 933 59 563 9359534 43499758968 563 34315896 94 563 294835 293819825 430759838 163 563 2856865 94 563 543156 94 54325-9859428 56 563 632 5943467365 86 71436 19188 363865 472281-2 86499437365 86 563 2149

In addition, there were multiple peace proposals coming from neutrals, or one side or the other; none of them progressed very far.	86 133858968 56343 2343 77958093 03133 049092192 397865 4497 637541928 94 963 2833 94 563 956340 6963 94 5637 0495432233 4346 4149
However, owing to economic difficulties and Germany being the only defeated power with an intact economy, the burden fell largely on Germany.	69234348 92865 59 33969783 384483795832 163 5347166 53865 563 9696 33431533 09234 2856 16 865135 33969768 563 574336 4399 9145396 96 53471669

For example, there were an estimated 186,000 British chemical weapons casualties during the war (80% of which were the result of exposure to the vesicant sulfur mustard, introduced to the battlefield by the Germans in July 1917, which burns the skin at any point of contact and inflicts more severe lung damage than chlorine or phosgene), and up to one-third of American casualties were caused by them.	494 32170938 56343 2343 16 325871533 1868000 5485826 36378319 2310962 3127195832 374865 563 214 9805 94 26836 2343 563 432795 94 32092743 59 563 43283165 279474 77251438 8654937333 59 563 51559348393 56 563 5347162 86 7796 19178 26836 57462 563 2886 15 166 09865 94 3965135 163 86498352 7943 234343 9765 317153 5616 36994863 94 0692536308 163 70 59 963-56843 94 17348316 3127195832 2343 317233 56 56379

Eventually, after the sinking of American merchant ships by German submarines, the declaration by Germany that its navy would resume unrestricted attacks on neutral shipping, and the revelation that Germany was trying to incite Mexico to make war on the United States, the U.S. declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917.	34365719968 14534 563 2868865 94 17348316 73436165 26802 56 534716 27571486328 563 33391415896 56 5347166 5615 852 6146 29793 432773 764325483533 1551382 96 6375419 268008658 163 563 4343915896 5615 5347166 212 546865 59 863853 732839 59 7183 214 96 563 768533 2515328 563 7929 33391433 214 96 5347166 96 6 10489 19179

A smaller part of the Arras offensive, the capture of Vimy Ridge by the Canadian Corps, became highly significant to that country: the idea that Canada's national identity was born out of the battle is an opinion widely held in military and general histories of Canada.The last large-scale offensive of this period was a British attack (with French support) at Passchendaele (July–November 1917).	1 2719934 0145 94 563 14412 9443628438 563 3105743 94 4876 48353 56 563 31613816 394028 533173 685696 28568483165 59 5615 39765460 563 8331 5615 316131-2 61589619 83365856 212 5946 975 94 563 515593 82 16 9086896 283396 6393 86 78985146 163 5363419 682594832 94 3161319563 9125 91453-23193 944362843 94 5682 034893 212 1 5485826 155138 92856 443636 27009450 15 0122363631393 97796–69437534 191709
According to Devlin, this was a serious breach of International Law, equivalent to German minelaying.	133943865 59 3349868 5682 212 1 2348972 543136 94 8653461589619 9128 3178419365 59 534716 78639168659
Germany sought to strangle Allied sea lanes before the United States could transport a large army overseas, but after initial successes eventually failed to do so.The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships began travelling in convoys, escorted by destroyers.	5347166 297565 59 25416593 199833 231 91632 534943 563 768533 251532 39793 541620945 1 91453 1476 943423128 575 14534 8685819 273332232 3436571996 418933 59 39 299563 7-5915 564315 93223633 86 19178 2636 73436165 26802 53516 5414399865 86 39649628 32394533 56 33254963429

This allowed France to counteract the Triple Alliance with the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894 and the 1904 Entente Cordiale with Britain, while in 1907 Britain and Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention.	5682 1999233 441633 59 3976534135 563 548093 19981633 2856 563 441639-4722816 19981633 94 1894 163 563 1904 3653653 39438193 2856 54851868 26893 86 1907 5485186 163 472281 285633 563 16599-4722816 39643658969
Hindenburg and Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the Central Powers and, a day after the Bulgarian collapse, insisted on an immediate peace settlement.	6863365745 163 9733639444 396397333 5615 563 254153583 163 90341589619 5191633 613 692 2684533 333833396 1518625 563 3365419 092342 1638 1 316 14534 563 579514816 399910238 86282533 96 16 877338153 03133 23559373659

Belgian historian Laurence Van Ypersele emphasises the central role played by memory of the war and the Versailles Treaty in German politics in the 1920s and 1930s: Active denial of war guilt in Germany and German resentment at both reparations and continued Allied occupation of the Rhineland made widespread revision of the meaning and memory of the war problematic.	5395816 682594816 91743633 416 60342393 3706128232 563 3365419 4993 091633 56 737946 94 563 214 163 563 4342189932 543156 86 534716 09985832 86 563 19202 163 193020 135843 336819 94 214 57895 86 5347166 163 534716 4323657365 15 5956 43014158962 163 396586733 199833 9337015896 94 563 468639163 7133 2833204313 43482896 94 563 7316865 163 737946 94 563 214 049593715839
The Central Asian Revolt started in the summer of 1916, when the Russian Empire government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service.In 1917, a series of French Army Mutinies led to dozens of soldiers being executed and many more imprisoned.	563 3365419 12816 434995 2514533 86 563 277734 94 19168 2636 563 4722816 370843 5943467365 36333 852 323705896 94 7729872 4497 78985146 2344833986 19178 1 234832 94 443636 1476 77586832 933 59 391362 94 29938342 53865 32337533 163 7166 7943 87048296339

In two days the British and Indian infantry, supported by a creeping barrage, broke the Ottoman front line and captured the headquarters of the Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire) at Tulkarm, the continuous trench lines at Tabsor, Arara, and the Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire) headquarters at Nablus.	86 529 3162 563 5485826 163 863816 864165468 270094533 56 1 34330865 51441538 54983 563 9559716 44965 9863 163 31057433 563 631317145342 94 563 385656 1476 99559716 3708430 15 57981478 563 3965867972 543636 98632 15 5152948 141418 163 563 2343656 1476 99559716 3708430 631317145342 15 6159729
Many more returned home with few after-effects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflict's growing mythological status.	7166 7943 43574633 6973 2856 432 14534-34433520 69234348 56384 2893633 15975 563 214 39654857533 59 563 39649835-2 5492865 765699958319 2515729
Since there was limited response to this tactic of the British, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.The Battle of Jutland (German: Skagerrakschlacht, or "Battle of the Skagerrak") in May/June 1916 developed into the largest naval battle of the war.	28633 56343 212 9878533 43209623 59 5682 513583 94 563 54858268 5347166 32033533 1 2878914 43209623 59 852 764325483533 275714863 21441439563 515593 94 7759163 95347160 281534418236913658 94 -515593 94 563 281534418-0 86 71607763 1916 334399033 8659 563 9145325 61419 515593 94 563 2149
By mid-November 1918, the Italian military occupied the entire former Austrian Littoral and had seized control of the portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the London Pact.	56 783-69437534 19188 563 8519816 78985146 93370833 563 365843 494734 17254816 98559419 163 613 238133 3965499 94 563 0945896 94 31971581 5615 613 5336 5714165333 59 85196 56 563 996396 01359
The German advance into France was halted at the Battle of the Marne and by the end of 1914, the Western Front settled into a battle of attrition, marked by a long series of trench lines that changed little until 1917 (the Eastern Front, by contrast, was marked by much greater exchanges of territory).	563 534716 1341633 8659 441633 212 619533 15 563 515593 94 563 71463 163 56 563 363 94 19148 563 2325346 44965 2355933 8659 1 515593 94 1554858968 714833 56 1 9965 234832 94 543636 98632 5615 3616533 985593 76589 1917 9563 3125346 449658 56 396541258 212 714833 56 7736 5431534 323616532 94 53448594609

Furthermore, it was common for Germans in the 1930s to justify acts of aggression due to perceived injustices imposed by the victors of World War I. American historian William Rubinstein wrote that: The 'Age of Totalitarianism' included nearly all the infamous examples of genocide in modern history, headed by the Jewish Holocaust, but also comprising the mass murders and purges of the Communist world, other mass killings carried out by Nazi Germany and its allies, and also the Armenian Genocide of 1915.	474563479438 85 212 397796 494 5347162 86 563 19302 59 7725846 1352 94 1554322896 373 59 034338433 8677258332 8709233 56 563 4835942 94 29493 214 89 17348316 682594816 2899817 4758625386 24953 56150 563 -153 94 595198514816827- 86397333 631496 199 563 86417972 32170932 94 53693833 86 793346 68259468 631333 56 563 732826 6999317258 575 1929 3970482865 563 7122 7743342 163 074532 94 563 397776825 294938 95634 7122 88998652 3144833 975 56 6118 5347166 163 852 1998328 163 1929 563 14736816 53693833 94 19159

New states enter the war In the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the South Caucasus: the First Republic of Armenia, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which declared their independence from the Russian Empire.	632 251532 36534 563 214 86 563 9153 204865 94 19188 56433 632 251532 2343 494733 86 563 29756 317312720 563 48425 43075983 94 14736818 563 1134518716 3379341583 430759838 163 563 3379341583 43075983 94 53945818 26836 33391433 56384 863303633633 4497 563 4722816 3708439
Areas taken in major attacks On the Western Front neither side made impressive gains in the first three years of the war with attacks at Verdun, the Somme, Passchendaele, and Cambrai — the exception was Nivelle's Offensive in which the German defence gave ground while mauling the attackers so badly that there were mutinies in the French Army.	14312 51836 86 71794 1551382 96 563 2325346 44965 6385634 2833 7133 8704322843 51862 86 563 48425 56433 63142 94 563 214 2856 1551382 15 4343768 563 297738 01223636313938 163 3175418 — 563 323305896 212 6843993-2 944362843 86 26836 563 534716 3343633 5143 549763 26893 7179865 563 155138342 29 51396 5615 56343 2343 77586832 86 563 443636 14769
This tactic made it difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the hydrophone and depth charges were introduced, accompanying destroyers could attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success.	5682 513583 7133 85 384483795 494 7-59152 59 4863 51453528 26836 2856848316596 93223633 9922320 14534 563 6634906963 163 33056 3614532 2343 86549373338 133970166865 3325496342 39793 155138 1 275734533 275714863 2856 2973 6903 94 27333229

Fakhri Pasha, the Ottoman commander of Medina, resisted for more than two and half years during the Siege of Medina before surrendering in January 1919.The Senussi tribe, along the border of Italian Libya and British Egypt, incited and armed by the Turks, waged a small-scale guerrilla war against Allied troops.	418648 012618 563 9559716 397716334 94 7338618 43282533 494 7943 5616 529 163 6194 63142 374865 563 28353 94 733861 534943 274436334865 86 7167146 19199563 2367228 548538 19965 563 594334 94 8519816 98561 163 5485826 356058 8638533 163 14733 56 563 574828 21533 1 27199-23193 573448991 214 1518625 199833 5499029
Technology Ground warfare World War I began as a clash of 20th-century technology and 19th-century tactics, with the inevitably large ensuing casualties.	5336699956 549763 2144143 29493 214 8 53516 12 1 39126 94 2056-3365746 5336699956 163 1956-3365746 51358328 2856 563 8634851596 91453 3627865 31271958329

The German high command responded by despatching troops to hold the line, but these forces were far too weak to reestablish a front.The disappearance of the Macedonian front meant that the road to Budapest and Vienna was now opened to Allied forces.	563 534716 6856 3977163 432096333 56 33201536865 549902 59 6993 563 98638 575 56323 494332 2343 414 599 2318 59 43325159826 1 449659563 3821003141633 94 563 7133396816 44965 73165 5615 563 4913 59 57310325 163 483661 212 692 903633 59 199833 4943329
Serbia's defeat of the Austro-Hungarian invasion of 1914 has been called one of the major upset victories of the twentieth century.	234581-2 334315 94 563 172549-676514816 86412896 94 1914 612 5336 319933 963 94 563 71794 70235 483594832 94 563 523658356 33657469
For years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled.	494 63142 14534214328 039093 7974633 563 33138 563 78228658 163 563 7166 382159339
The Spring Offensive sought to divide the British and French forces with a series of feints and advances.	563 204865 944362843 297565 59 384833 563 5485826 163 443636 494332 2856 1 234832 94 438652 163 134163329
The Allies successes came later in Palestine, the beginning of the end for the Ottomans, in Macedonia, which drove the Bulgarians out of the war, and at Vittorio Veneto, the final blow for the Austro-Hungarians.	563 199832 273332232 3173 91534 86 0193258638 563 535866865 94 563 363 494 563 955971628 86 7133396818 26836 34943 563 5795148162 975 94 563 2148 163 15 48559489 4363598 563 48619 5992 494 563 172549-67651481629
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.	563 25415356 049433 3443358438 3755865 944 48519 78985146 163 38489816 270098328 19569756 5682 59938133 48991533 13330533 8653461589619 912 39384833 56 2343419 8653461589619 1543373652 94 563 0125 529 3365748329
Chemical weapons in warfare The German army was the first to successfully deploy chemical weapons during the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April – 25 May 1915), after German scientists working under the direction of Fritz Haber at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute developed a method to weaponize chlorine.	36378319 2310962 86 2144143 563 534716 1476 212 563 48425 59 273332247996 330996 36378319 2310962 374865 563 233963 515593 94 60432 922 10489 – 25 716 191508 14534 534716 2383658252 2948865 76334 563 384335896 94 44851 61534 15 563 818234 2896397 862585753 334399033 1 735693 59 231096813 369948639
The Kaiser, kings and other hereditary rulers all were removed from power and Wilhelm fled to exile in the Netherlands.	563 8182348 88652 163 95634 6343385146 479342 199 2343 4379433 4497 09234 163 2896397 4933 59 32893 86 563 635634916329

Armenia was left to fend for itself and struggled for five months against the threat of a full-fledged occupation by the Ottoman Turks before defeating them at the Battle of Sardarabad.	1473681 212 9345 59 4363 494 852394 163 254755933 494 4843 796562 1518625 563 564315 94 1 4799-4933533 9337015896 56 563 9559716 57482 534943 334315865 5637 15 563 515593 94 21431415139

Ottoman Empire The Ottomans threatened Russia's Caucasian territories and Britain's communications with India via the Suez Canal.	9559716 370843 563 95597162 5643153633 472281-2 317312816 53448594832 163 5485186-2 39777683158962 2856 86381 481 563 2731 316199
The United States held 48,000.	563 768533 251532 6393 4880009
Learning of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January.	93146865 94 563 534716 432096238 563 199833 59434673652 2343 4433 59 7183 39314 3371632 86 56384 43209623 94 14 71671469
The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive.	563 3365419 092342 8632 5615 5636 39793 695 286 1 0495413533 2148 575 5636 6393 6856 69032 494 2733322 51233 96 1 48619 17838 9443628439
Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it.	199833 9313342 613 692 43198233 5615 59 39658673 16 155138 14534 4328251633 613 61433633 212 1 21253 94 984328 163 85 212 535534 59 5746 1 9863 5616 59 546 59 4999 9434 859
The increasingly incompetent rule of Empress Alexandra drew protests and resulted in the murder of her favourite, Rasputin, at the end of 1916.	563 863431286596 86397035365 4793 94 3704322 193216341 3432 04953252 163 43279533 86 563 774334 94 634 4149748538 412075868 15 563 363 94 19169

Trained American forces would not begin arriving at the front in large numbers until mid-1918, but ultimately the American Expeditionary Force would reach some two million troops.Though Serbia was defeated in 1915, and Romania joined the Allied Powers in 1916 only to be defeated in 1917, none of the great powers were knocked out of the war until 1918.	5418633 17348316 494332 29793 695 53586 14484865 15 563 44965 86 91453 6775342 76589 783-19188 575 7958715396 563 17348316 3203385896146 49433 29793 43136 2973 529 7899896 5499029569756 234581 212 33431533 86 19158 163 4971681 798633 563 199833 092342 86 1916 9696 59 53 33431533 86 19178 6963 94 563 54315 092342 2343 8693833 975 94 563 214 76589 19189
Russian Revolution Despite Russia's success in the June 1916 Brusilov Offensive against the Austrians in eastern Galicia, the offensive was undermined by the reluctance of other Russian generals to commit their forces to support the victory.	4722816 4349975896 3320853 472281-2 2733322 86 563 7763 1916 54728994 944362843 1518625 563 172548162 86 3125346 51983818 563 944362843 212 7633478633 56 563 4397351633 94 95634 4722816 53634192 59 397785 56384 494332 59 2700945 563 48359469
Overall the Germans felt they had been unjustly dealt with by what they called the "diktat of Versailles".	9434199 563 5347162 4395 5636 613 5336 76772596 33195 2856 56 2615 5636 319933 563 -388515 94 4342189932-9
In our ignorance I, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust—probably not more than one-quarter of us—learned how right the General's prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it.	86 974 856941633 88 163 7166 94 728 4395 197925 1261733 94 1 5485826 5363419 269 7553433 2736 3304322865 163 76015489583 23658736528 575 374865 563 6325 4974 631428 56923 94 72 269 27448433 563 699931725—04951596 695 7943 5616 963-1714534 94 72—9314633 692 48565 563 5363419-2 049569282 212 163 692 3974153972 63 613 5336 59 75534 859
This tactic made it difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the hydrophone and depth charges were introduced, accompanying destroyers could attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success.	5682 513583 7133 85 384483795 494 7-59152 59 4863 51453528 26836 2856848316596 93223633 9922320 14534 563 6634906963 163 33056 3614532 2343 86549373338 133970166865 3325496342 39793 155138 1 275734533 275714863 2856 2973 6903 94 27333229
On 1 August, after the Russian response, Germany mobilised and declared war on Russia.	96 1 1757258 14534 563 4722816 432096238 5347166 795898233 163 33391433 214 96 4722819
Industrial output was half the 1913 levels.	8637254819 975075 212 6194 563 1913 9343929
Infantry formations were reorganised, so that 100-man companies were no longer the main unit of manoeuvre; instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior NCO, were favoured.	86416546 4947158962 2343 439451682338 29 5615 100-716 397016832 2343 69 996534 563 7186 7685 94 7169374430 86253138 217132 94 10 94 29 7368 76334 563 3977163 94 1 776894 6398 2343 414974339
The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines, and indeed the resulting panic led to the diversion of several squadrons of fighters from France.	563 5347162 396373533 184 41832 96 3659163 374865 1915 163 1916 2856 184268028 690865 59 317153 5485826 794193 163 31723 18434145 59 53 38434533 4497 563 44965 986328 163 863333 563 432795865 01683 933 59 563 384342896 94 2343419 217134962 94 48565342 4497 4416339
At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output), and smaller versions were not developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by the British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.Recognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets for enemy aircraft.	15 563 58738 0141367532 2343 599 63146 59 53 7233 56 089952 94 18434145 92856 56384 71458619 09234 97507508 163 2719934 43428962 2343 695 334399033 76589 563 363 94 563 2140 5636 2343 1929 9009233 56 563 5485826 93133426808 269 431433 5636 78565 0497953 39214383394339568233 494 56384 41973 12 95234415896 0915494728 51999962 2343 870945165 5145352 494 36376 184341459
Austria-Hungary was partitioned into several successor states, including Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, largely but not entirely along ethnic lines.	1725481-6765146 212 01458589633 8659 2343419 273332294 2515328 863973865 17254818 67651468 313369299418818 163 67592914818 9145396 575 695 36584396 19965 356683 986329
On 30 October, the Ottoman Empire capitulated, signing the Armistice of Mudros.	96 30 93595348 563 9559716 370843 310857915338 2856865 563 147825833 94 7734929
Lloyd George's War Cabinet considered the German offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies.	99963 539453-2 214 3158635 3962833433 563 534716 94434 59 53 1 0996 59 343153 384828962 1796525 563 1998329
The army became increasingly ineffective.Following the Tsar's abdication, Vladimir Lenin—with the help of the German government—was ushered by train from Switzerland into Russia 16 April 1917.	563 1476 533173 863431286596 863443358439499992865 563 5214-2 15383158968 49138784 93686—2856 563 6390 94 563 534716 5943467365—212 7263433 56 54186 4497 22851349163 8659 472281 16 10489 19179

The government of Turkey has consistently denied the genocide, arguing that those who died were victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine, or disease during World War I; these claims are rejected by most historians.Other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the Ottoman Empire during this period, including Assyrians and Greeks, and some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination.	563 5943467365 94 574836 612 396282536596 336833 563 536938338 1457865 5615 56923 269 3833 2343 4835872 94 86534-356683 485658658 4178638 94 3823123 374865 29493 214 80 56323 391872 143 43733533 56 7925 6825948162995634 356683 549702 2343 287891496 15513833 56 563 9559716 370843 374865 5682 0348938 863973865 122648162 163 5433828 163 2973 23699142 39628334 56923 343652 59 53 0145 94 563 2173 099836 94 32534786158969
The living conditions made it so that countless diseases and infections occurred, such as trench foot, shell shock, blindness/burns from mustard gas, lice, trench fever, "cooties" (body lice) and the 'Spanish flu'.To maintain morale, wartime censors minimised early reports of widespread influenza illness and mortality in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.	563 984865 3963858962 7133 85 29 5615 397659322 38231232 163 8643358962 933744338 2736 12 543636 49958 26399 269388 598636322057462 4497 7725143 5128 98338 543636 434348 -3995832- 95936 98330 163 563 -2016826 497-959 71865186 7941938 2145873 3362942 786878233 31496 4309452 94 2833204313 864973611 8996322 163 794519856 86 53471668 563 768533 88653978 4416338 163 563 768533 2515329

The 1919 Treaty of Versailles dealt with Germany and, building on Wilson's 14th point, brought into being the League of Nations on 28 June 1919.The Central Powers had to acknowledge responsibility for "all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by" their aggression.	563 1919 543156 94 4342189932 33195 2856 5347166 1638 57893865 96 289296-2 1456 098658 5497565 8659 53865 563 931573 94 6158962 96 28 7763 19199563 3365419 092342 613 59 13869293353 43209628589856 494 -199 563 9922 163 317153 59 26836 563 199833 163 1229381533 59434673652 163 56384 615896192 6143 5336 275733533 12 1 39623173633 94 563 214 8709233 7096 5637 56- 56384 15543228969
Once the war began, Austrian, British, French, German, and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their countries' intervention in the war.Italian nationalism was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions.	9633 563 214 535168 172548168 54858268 4436368 5347168 163 4722816 2938198252 49999233 563 482865 61589619825 3744365 56 2700945865 56384 397654832- 865344365896 86 563 21498519816 61589619827 212 2584433 56 563 97554318 94 563 214 163 212 868581996 25496596 270094533 56 1 4148356 94 099858319 413589629

Mussolini, a syndicalist who supported the war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian-populated regions of Austria-Hungary, formed the pro-interventionist Il Popolo d'Italia and the Fasci Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista ("Revolutionary Fasci for International Action") in October 1914 that later developed into the Fasci di Combattimento in 1919, the origin of fascism.	7722998688 1 26638319825 269 270094533 563 214 96 5497632 94 84433365825 391872 96 8519816-090791533 4358962 94 1725481-67651468 494733 563 049-865344365896825 89 090999 3-851981 163 563 41238 48499718961489 3-118963 86534611896198251 9-4349975896146 41238 494 8653461589619 135896-0 86 9359534 1914 5615 91534 334399033 8659 563 41238 38 3975155873659 86 19198 563 948586 94 41238279
Once prisoners reached a camp, conditions were, in general, satisfactory (and much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the International Red Cross and inspections by neutral nations.	9633 048296342 4313633 1 31708 3963858962 23438 86 53634198 215824135946 9163 7736 535534 5616 86 29493 214 8808 561682 86 0145 59 563 3449452 94 563 8653461589619 433 34922 163 86203358962 56 6375419 61589629
In time, however, technology began to produce new offensive weapons, such as gas warfare and the tank.After the First Battle of the Marne (5–12 September 1914), Allied and German forces unsuccessfully tried to outflank each other, a series of manoeuvres later known as the "Race to the Sea".	86 58738 69234348 5336699956 53516 59 0493733 632 944362843 23109628 2736 12 512 2144143 163 563 5168914534 563 48425 515593 94 563 71463 95–12 230537534 191408 199833 163 534716 494332 76273332247996 54833 59 97549168 3136 956348 1 234832 94 7169374432 91534 86926 12 563 -4133 59 563 231-9

I much regret it, and hope even now that some way may be found of securing agreement for demanding reparation commensurate with the tremendous sacrifices made by the British Empire and her Allies."	8 7736 435435 858 163 6903 3436 692 5615 2973 216 716 53 49763 94 23374865 154337365 494 337163865 4301415896 397736274153 2856 563 5437363972 2134848332 7133 56 563 5485826 370843 163 634 1998329-
Infantry formations were reorganised, so that 100-man companies were no longer the main unit of manoeuvre; instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior NCO, were favoured.	86416546 4947158962 2343 439451682338 29 5615 100-716 397016832 2343 69 996534 563 7186 7685 94 7169374430 86253138 217132 94 10 94 29 7368 76334 563 3977163 94 1 776894 6398 2343 414974339

The agreements did not constitute formal alliances, but by settling long-standing colonial disputes, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility; these interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the Triple Entente.	563 1543373652 383 695 3962585753 494719 1998163328 575 56 23559865 9965-25163865 39996819 382075328 5636 7133 5485826 36546 8659 166 475743 39649835 864994865 441633 94 472281 1 092285898560 56323 865349938865 589153419 1543373652 533173 86926 12 563 548093 36536539

Hindenburg and Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the Central Powers and, a day after the Bulgarian collapse, insisted on an immediate peace settlement.	6863365745 163 9733639444 396397333 5615 563 254153583 163 90341589619 5191633 613 692 2684533 333833396 1518625 563 3365419 092342 1638 1 316 14534 563 579514816 399910238 86282533 96 16 877338153 03133 23559373659
Moreover, between 1915 and 1926, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica spread around the world affecting nearly five million people.The social disruption and widespread violence of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the ensuing Russian Civil War sparked more than 2,000 pogroms in the former Russian Empire, mostly in Ukraine.	794394348 5352336 1915 163 19268 16 30833783 94 363306198582 9356145831 204313 149763 563 29493 144335865 631496 4843 7899896 0390939563 293819 3824705896 163 2833204313 48993633 94 563 4722816 4349975896 94 1917 163 563 3627865 4722816 38489 214 2014833 7943 5616 28000 0954972 86 563 494734 4722816 3708438 792596 86 78418639

Germany complied.	5347166 397098339
From the Central Powers about 3.3 million men became prisoners; most of them surrendered to Russians.	4497 563 3365419 092342 15975 393 7899896 736 533173 0482963420 7925 94 5637 27443633433 59 472281629
The German Army employed 150 mm (6 in) and 210 mm (8 in) howitzers in 1914, when typical French and British guns were only 75 mm (3 in) and 105 mm (4 in).	563 534716 1476 37099633 150 77 96 860 163 210 77 98 860 692851342 86 19148 2636 5608319 443636 163 5485826 5762 2343 9696 75 77 93 860 163 105 77 94 8609

Chemical weapons in warfare The German army was the first to successfully deploy chemical weapons during the Second Battle of Ypres (22 April – 25 May 1915), after German scientists working under the direction of Fritz Haber at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute developed a method to weaponize chlorine.	36378319 2310962 86 2144143 563 534716 1476 212 563 48425 59 273332247996 330996 36378319 2310962 374865 563 233963 515593 94 60432 922 10489 – 25 716 191508 14534 534716 2383658252 2948865 76334 563 384335896 94 44851 61534 15 563 818234 2896397 862585753 334399033 1 735693 59 231096813 369948639

Four dynasties, together with their ancillary aristocracies, fell as a result of the war: the Romanovs, the Hohenzollerns, the Habsburgs, and the Ottomans.	4974 3661258328 59535634 2856 56384 163899146 14825934138328 4399 12 1 432795 94 563 2140 563 497169428 563 69636199934628 563 6152574528 163 563 955971629
Thus, following the Second World War, at the London Conference in 1953, Germany agreed to resume payment on the money borrowed.	56728 499992865 563 233963 29493 2148 15 563 996396 3964343633 86 19538 5347166 154333 59 432773 0167365 96 563 79636 594492339
Barbed wire was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances, while artillery, vastly more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with machine guns, made crossing open ground extremely difficult.	514533 2843 212 1 28568483165 686341633 59 712233 86416546 134163328 26893 1458993468 412596 7943 935619 5616 86 563 187028 3970933 2856 7136863 57628 7133 34922865 9036 549763 325437396 3844837959
The Armistice of Mudros, signed at the end of October, ended hostilities with the Ottoman Empire when fighting was continuing north of Aleppo.	563 147825833 94 7734928 285633 15 563 363 94 93595348 36333 69258985832 2856 563 9559716 370843 2636 48565865 212 3965867865 69456 94 1930099
Britain was safe from starvation, while German industrial output fell, and the United States joined the war far earlier than Germany had anticipated.	5485186 212 2143 4497 25144158968 26893 534716 8637254819 975075 43998 163 563 768533 251532 798633 563 214 414 3149834 5616 5347166 613 165838015339
The Big Four (Britain, France, the United States, and Italy) imposed their terms on the defeated powers in a series of treaties agreed at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, the most well known being the German peace treaty—the Treaty of Versailles.	563 585 4974 954851868 4416338 563 768533 2515328 163 851960 8709233 56384 53472 96 563 33431533 092342 86 1 234832 94 54315832 154333 15 563 1919 01482 03133 39643436338 563 7925 2399 86926 53865 563 534716 03133 543156—563 543156 94 43421899329
Germany and Austria-Hungary relied on faster mobilisation to compensate for fewer numbers; it was concern at the closing of this gap that led to the end of the naval race, rather than a reduction in tension elsewhere.	5347166 163 1725481-6765146 439833 96 412534 795898215896 59 3970362153 494 43234 67753420 85 212 3963346 15 563 3992865 94 5682 510 5615 933 59 563 363 94 563 61419 41338 415634 5616 1 433735896 86 5362896 3923263439

Consequently, the publication of Benedict's proposed seven-point Peace Note of August 1917 was roundly ignored by all parties except Austria-Hungary.	3962317365968 563 07598315896 94 53633835-2 04909233 23436-09865 03133 6953 94 175725 1917 212 4976396 8569433 56 199 0145832 323305 1725481-67651469
Though these views have been discounted as "myths", they are common.	569756 56323 48322 6143 5336 3823976533 12 -76562-8 5636 143 3977969
These pushed the front line north to more advantageous positions for the Entente in preparation for an attack and to acclimatise the newly arrived Indian Army infantry.	56323 072633 563 44965 9863 69456 59 7943 134165153972 092858962 494 563 3653653 86 04301415896 494 16 155138 163 59 13398715823 563 63296 1448433 863816 1476 864165469
In November 1918, the Allies had ample supplies of men and materiel to invade Germany.	86 69437534 19188 563 199832 613 17093 27009832 94 736 163 71534839 59 864133 53471669
German prisoners were still being held in Russia as late as 1924.	534716 048296342 2343 25899 53865 6393 86 472281 12 9153 12 19249
However, he also repeatedly warned that the United States would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law.	69234348 63 1929 4303153396 214633 5615 563 768533 251532 29793 695 59934153 764325483533 275714863 21441438 86 489915896 94 8653461589619 9129

By July 1914, the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions: the Triple Entente—consisting of France, Russia, and Britain—and the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy (the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature, allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915, when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated).	56 7796 19148 563 54315 092342 94 374903 2343 3848333 8659 529 39198589620 563 548093 3653653—3962825865 94 4416338 4722818 163 5485186—163 563 548093 19981633 94 53471668 1725481-67651468 163 85196 9563 548093 19981633 212 9696 334362843 86 6157438 19992865 85196 59 2516 975 94 563 214 76589 10489 19158 2636 85 798633 563 199833 092342 14534 852 439158962 2856 1725481-6765146 33534894153309
On 3 October 2010, Germany made the final payment on these bonds.The war contributed to the evolution of the wristwatch from women's jewellery to a practical everyday item, replacing the pocketwatch, which requires a free hand to operate.	96 3 9359534 20108 5347166 7133 563 48619 0167365 96 56323 596329563 214 39654857533 59 563 349975896 94 563 2482521536 4497 29736-2 732399346 59 1 041358319 34346316 85378 430913865 563 093835215368 26836 43178432 1 4433 6163 59 90341539
Those who survived were shocked, disillusioned and embittered by their war experiences, and saw that their real enemies were not the Germans, but the old men at home who had lied to them.	56923 269 27448433 2343 26938338 3828997289633 163 3758553433 56 56384 214 320348363328 163 212 5615 56384 4319 3637832 2343 695 563 53471628 575 563 993 736 15 6973 269 613 9833 59 56379
However, this attempt was rejected out of hand as a "duplicitous war ruse".Soon after, the US president, Woodrow Wilson, attempted to intervene as a peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands.	69234348 5682 1553705 212 43733533 975 94 6163 12 1 -37098385972 214 4723-92996 145348 563 72 0432833658 2993492 2892968 155370533 59 865344363 12 1 03133718348 128865 86 1 6953 494 5956 28332 59 25153 56384 33716329

Since the Germans were able to choose where to stand, they normally had the advantage of the high ground; in addition, their trenches tended to be better built, since Anglo-French trenches were initially intended as "temporary," preparatory to breaking the German defences.Both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances.	28633 563 5347162 2343 1593 59 369923 26343 59 251638 5636 69471996 613 563 134165153 94 563 6856 5497630 86 133858968 56384 54363632 536333 59 53 535534 578958 28633 16599-443636 54363632 2343 868581996 86536333 12 -5370941468- 04301415946 59 54318865 563 534716 3343633295956 28332 54833 59 54318 563 251937153 72865 2383658483 163 5336699958319 134163329

Ultimately, Moltke's changes meant insufficient forces to achieve decisive success and thus unrealistic goals and timings.The initial German advance in the West was very successful: by the end of August the Allied left, which included the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), was in full retreat; French casualties in the first month exceeded 260,000, including 27,000 killed on 22 August during the Battle of the Frontiers.	79587153968 799583-2 3616532 73165 862744838365 494332 59 1368343 33382843 2733322 163 5672 76431982583 59192 163 58786529563 8685819 534716 1341633 86 563 2325 212 4346 27333224790 56 563 363 94 175725 563 199833 93458 26836 86397333 563 5485826 3203385896146 49433 953408 212 86 4799 43543150 443636 3127195832 86 563 48425 79656 32333333 26080008 863973865 278000 889933 96 22 175725 374865 563 515593 94 563 4496583429
