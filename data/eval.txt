This conspiracy theory of betrayal became common, and the German populace came to see themselves as victims.	5682 3962084136 563946 94 53541619 533173 3977968 163 563 534716 09079133 3173 59 233 5637239432 12 48358729

The use of chemical warfare and small-scale strategic bombing (as opposed to tactical bombing) were both outlawed by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, and both proved to be of limited effectiveness, though they captured the public imagination.The most powerful land-based weapons were railway guns, weighing dozens of tons apiece.	563 723 94 36378319 2144143 163 27199-23193 254153583 5975865 912 9009233 59 51358319 59758650 2343 5956 97591233 56 563 61573 39643658962 94 1899 163 19078 163 5956 049433 59 53 94 9878533 34433584363228 569756 5636 31057433 563 075983 871586158969563 7925 09234479 9163-51233 2310962 2343 4189216 57628 23856865 391362 94 5962 1083339

German planning provided broad strategic instructions, while allowing army commanders considerable freedom in carrying them out at the front; this worked well in 1866 and 1870 but in 1914, von Kluck used this freedom to disobey orders, opening a gap between the German armies as they closed on Paris.	534716 09166865 04948333 54913 254153583 8625473589628 26893 19992865 1476 3977163342 396283341593 4433397 86 31446865 5637 975 15 563 449650 5682 294833 2399 86 1866 163 1870 575 86 19148 496 89738 7233 5682 4433397 59 3829536 9433428 9036865 1 510 5352336 563 534716 147832 12 5636 399233 96 014829

The German advance into France was halted at the Battle of the Marne and by the end of 1914, the Western Front settled into a battle of attrition, marked by a long series of trench lines that changed little until 1917 (the Eastern Front, by contrast, was marked by much greater exchanges of territory).	563 534716 1341633 8659 441633 212 619533 15 563 515593 94 563 71463 163 56 563 363 94 19148 563 2325346 44965 2355933 8659 1 515593 94 1554858968 714833 56 1 9965 234832 94 543636 98632 5615 3616533 985593 76589 1917 9563 3125346 449658 56 396541258 212 714833 56 7736 5431534 323616532 94 53448594609

With its allies defeated, revolution at home, and the military no longer willing to fight, Kaiser Wilhelm abdicated on 9 November and Germany signed an armistice on 11 November 1918, effectively ending the war.	2856 852 199832 334315338 4349975896 15 69738 163 563 78985146 69 996534 2899865 59 485658 818234 2896397 153831533 96 9 69437534 163 5347166 285633 16 147825833 96 11 69437534 19188 34433584396 363865 563 2149
At the start of hostilities, Italy refused to commit troops, arguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive and that Austria-Hungary was an aggressor.	15 563 25145 94 692589858328 85196 4347233 59 397785 5499028 1457865 5615 563 548093 19981633 212 334362843 163 5615 1725481-6765146 212 16 1554322949
Russia became the Soviet Union and lost Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, which became independent countries.	472281 533173 563 294835 76896 163 9925 48691638 32596818 9856716818 163 9154818 26836 533173 86330363365 3976548329
Because Russia's European ports were not safe, the corps was evacuated by a long detour via the port of Vladivostok.	5331723 472281-2 37490316 09452 2343 695 21438 563 39402 212 341371533 56 1 9965 335974 481 563 0945 94 491384925989

They rejected the values of the society that had sent them to war, and in doing so separated their own generation from the past and from their cultural inheritance.	5636 43733533 563 419732 94 563 2938356 5615 613 2365 5637 59 2148 163 86 39865 29 230141533 56384 926 5363415896 4497 563 0125 163 4497 56384 37957419 866348516339
As a result, Austria had to keep sizeable forces on the Serbian front, weakening its efforts against Russia.	12 1 4327958 1725481 613 59 8330 28131593 494332 96 563 2345816 449658 231836865 852 3449452 1518625 4722819

The Legion in Russia was established in September 1914, in December 1917 in France (including volunteers from America) and in April 1918 in Italy.	563 935896 86 472281 212 32515982633 86 230537534 19148 86 33337534 1917 86 441633 9863973865 4997653342 4497 17348310 163 86 10489 1918 86 851969
Opposition to the war Once war was declared, many socialists and trade unions backed their governments.	9009285896 59 563 214 9633 214 212 333914338 7166 2938198252 163 54133 768962 513833 56384 594346736529
The war is not now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy.	563 214 82 695 692 2336 12 1 -48565 15975 6956865-8 575 12 1 214 94 8331928 1 25475593 5352336 1554322843 7898514827 163 7943 94 9322 9853419 3379341369
Internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for automobiles and trucks/lorries eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.	86534619 3975725896 3658632 163 87049433 54135896 2625372 494 17597958932 163 54738209944832 3436571996 43633433 543636 41892162 952993539
Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented.	56384 94483342 913833 563 73162 59 076826 16 365843 384828968 163 61426 73127432 2343 695 87733815396 870937365339

However, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of a decisive outcome while it had failed to achieve the primary objective of avoiding a long, two-front war.	69234348 39777683158962 04959372 163 173258961593 3977163 333828962 3925 5347166 563 361633 94 1 33382843 9753973 26893 85 613 418933 59 1368343 563 0487146 957335843 94 14983865 1 99658 529-44965 2149

This resulted in the stab-in-the-back legend, which attributed Germany's defeat not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the 1918 flu pandemic and unfit to fight), but to the public's failure to respond to its "patriotic calling" and the supposed intentional sabotage of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists, and Bolsheviks.	5682 43279533 86 563 2515-86-563-5138 9353638 26836 1554857533 5347166-2 334315 695 59 852 861589856 59 39658673 48565865 93436 569756 70 59 1 7899896 29938342 2343 274434865 4497 563 1918 497 01633783 163 76485 59 4856508 575 59 563 075983-2 4189743 59 4320963 59 852 -015489583 3199865- 163 563 27009233 86536589619 21595153 94 563 214 3449458 014583791496 56 73228 29381982528 163 59926348829

The publishing of the book The Influence of Sea Power upon History by Alfred Thayer Mahan in 1890 was intended to encourage the United States to increase their naval power.	563 0759826865 94 563 5998 563 864973633 94 231 09234 7096 6825946 56 194433 561634 71616 86 1890 212 86536333 59 363974153 563 768533 251532 59 86343123 56384 61419 092349
However, the Italian Socialist Party decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors were killed, resulting in a general strike called Red Week.	69234348 563 8519816 293819825 01456 3338333 59 900923 563 214 14534 1658-7898514825 0495325942 2343 8899338 432795865 86 1 5363419 254883 319933 433 23389
However, it was also driven by Wilhelm's admiration of the Royal Navy and desire to outdo it.This resulted in the Anglo-German naval arms race but the launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1906 gave the Royal Navy a technological advantage over its German rival, which they never lost.	69234348 85 212 1929 348436 56 2896397-2 1378415896 94 563 49619 6146 163 332843 59 97539 8595682 43279533 86 563 16599-534716 61419 1472 4133 575 563 917636 94 672 34313697565 86 1906 5143 563 49619 6146 1 5336699958319 134165153 9434 852 534716 484198 26836 5636 63434 99259

Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and Bolshevik Russian governments following talks between 5 and 9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania formally attached Bessarabia, inhabited by a Romanian majority, to its territory, based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of that territory on its unification with Romania.Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the Treaty of Bucharest on 7 May 1918.	19569756 1 543156 212 285633 56 563 49716816 163 599263488 4722816 59434673652 499992865 51982 5352336 5 163 9 71436 1918 96 563 2856341219 94 49716816 494332 4497 5322141581 285686 529 7965628 96 27 71436 1918 4971681 49471996 15513633 53221415818 866158533 56 1 49716816 717948568 59 852 5344859468 51233 96 1 4329975896 012233 56 563 99319 12237596 94 5615 534485946 96 852 76848315896 2856 497168194971681 9448381996 7133 03133 2856 563 3365419 092342 56 2856865 563 543156 94 573614325 96 7 716 19189
British Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig wrote in his diary, "My officers and I were aware that such weapons would cause harm to women and children living in nearby towns, as strong winds were common in the battlefront.	5485826 48393 7142619 284 3975912 6185 24953 86 682 381468 -76 94483342 163 8 2343 12143 5615 2736 2310962 29793 31723 6147 59 29736 163 36893436 984865 86 631456 592628 12 254965 28632 2343 397796 86 563 515593449659
AEF doctrine called for the use of frontal assaults, which had long since been discarded by British Empire and French commanders due to the large loss of life that resulted.A Supreme War Council of Allied forces was created at the Doullens Conference on 5 November 1917.	134 39354863 319933 494 563 723 94 4496519 122179528 26836 613 9965 28633 5336 382314333 56 5485826 370843 163 443636 3977163342 373 59 563 91453 9922 94 9843 5615 4327953391 2704373 214 3976389 94 199833 494332 212 3431533 15 563 39799362 3964343633 96 5 69437534 19179

Since there was limited response to this tactic of the British, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.The Battle of Jutland (German: Skagerrakschlacht, or "Battle of the Skagerrak") in May/June 1916 developed into the largest naval battle of the war.	28633 56343 212 9878533 43209623 59 5682 513583 94 563 54858268 5347166 32033533 1 2878914 43209623 59 852 764325483533 275714863 21441439563 515593 94 7759163 95347160 281534418236913658 94 -515593 94 563 281534418-0 86 71607763 1916 334399033 8659 563 9145325 61419 515593 94 563 2149

The engagement was a stand off, as the Germans were outmanoeuvred by the larger British fleet, but managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the British fleet than they received.	563 3651537365 212 1 25163 9448 12 563 5347162 2343 9757169374433 56 563 914534 5485826 493358 575 7161533 59 323103 163 864983533 7943 317153 59 563 5485826 49335 5616 5636 433384339

The use of chemical warfare and small-scale strategic bombing (as opposed to tactical bombing) were both outlawed by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, and both proved to be of limited effectiveness, though they captured the public imagination.The most powerful land-based weapons were railway guns, weighing dozens of tons apiece.	563 723 94 36378319 2144143 163 27199-23193 254153583 5975865 912 9009233 59 51358319 59758650 2343 5956 97591233 56 563 61573 39643658962 94 1899 163 19078 163 5956 049433 59 53 94 9878533 34433584363228 569756 5636 31057433 563 075983 871586158969563 7925 09234479 9163-51233 2310962 2343 4189216 57628 23856865 391362 94 5962 1083339

By July 1914, the great powers of Europe were divided into two coalitions: the Triple Entente—consisting of France, Russia, and Britain—and the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy (the Triple Alliance was only defensive in nature, allowing Italy to stay out of the war until April 1915, when it joined the Allied Powers after its relations with Austria-Hungary deteriorated).	56 7796 19148 563 54315 092342 94 374903 2343 3848333 8659 529 39198589620 563 548093 3653653—3962825865 94 4416338 4722818 163 5485186—163 563 548093 19981633 94 53471668 1725481-67651468 163 85196 9563 548093 19981633 212 9696 334362843 86 6157438 19992865 85196 59 2516 975 94 563 214 76589 10489 19158 2636 85 798633 563 199833 092342 14534 852 439158962 2856 1725481-6765146 33534894153309
At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output), and smaller versions were not developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by the British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.Recognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets for enemy aircraft.	15 563 58738 0141367532 2343 599 63146 59 53 7233 56 089952 94 18434145 92856 56384 71458619 09234 97507508 163 2719934 43428962 2343 695 334399033 76589 563 363 94 563 2140 5636 2343 1929 9009233 56 563 5485826 93133426808 269 431433 5636 78565 0497953 39214383394339568233 494 56384 41973 12 95234415896 0915494728 51999962 2343 870945165 5145352 494 36376 184341459
